        <p>Each year more than 3.3 million dogs are dropped off at animal shelters. Before deciding to add a dog to your family do the research, and make a choice that is best for you, your family and the dog you plan to bring home. Add a dog to your family for life, not until they chew up your favorite pair of shoes.</p>
        <p>Of the dogs brought to shelters, the majority were less than a year old, almost half had not been neutered/spayed, a third had never been to the vet and almost none, 96%, had no obedience training.  Almost a third of these animals had been given to the owner by a friend but many were from breeders or shelters. A dog can be a wonderful addition to your family but make an educated decision, this should be a life long decision. </p>
