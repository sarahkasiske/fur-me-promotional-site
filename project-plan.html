              <h2>Project Overview</h2>
              <p>The goal of Fur Me is to reduce the number of dogs returned and ensure dogs are placed in appropriate homes by assisting users in making an informed decision when choosing a dog breed.</p>
              <p>Many dogs are living in homes where they do not receive the care they need. This is not necessarily because their owners do not care, but because they do not understand what type of care their dog requires. For example, someone might not understand why their pet is destructive when they are away. Rather than assuming their dog is bad they should be questioning what might have caused them to be destructive in the first place. Destructiveness often occurs in dog breeds that require stimulation and exercise. If they do not receive enough exercise and do not have brain stimulating toys, they can become bored when left alone and become destructive. In addition to this some dogs are returned because their owners were either not prepared to take care of a dog or did not choose a breed that suits their home and lifestyle.</p>
              <p>While there is a vast amount of information online it is challenging to find everything you need to know on one website. Additionally, many of these sites do not provide enough information about what caring for a dog means. This process can be frustrating and time consuming for someone looking for a dog. Because of this it is likely many people do not conduct enough research to know if they can care for a dog or  find out if a dog breed will fit their lifestyle.</p>
              <p>Fur Me will allow users to find all of the information they need about dog breeds and caring for a dog in one location. With this website users will be able to make an informed decision about what dog breed would be most suitable for their home and lifestyle without scouring multiple websites for information. Users should leave Fur Me feeling as though they are able to make an informed decision about owning a dog.</p>

                <p>The primary audience for Fur Me is young adults who are in the process of choosing their first dog. Other audiences include anyone looking to select a dog, people interested in learning more about dog breeds, adopting dogs or purchasing a dog and people considering if they would be able to adopt or purchase a dog.</p>

              <h2>Review of Existing Products</h2>
              <p>There are many websites sharing information about different dog breeds. The American Kennel Club, dogtime.com, Dog Breed Info Center, vetSTREET, IAMS are just a few. These websites provide varying information about different dog breeds. The AKC provides trustworthy information and will test how well you match to a dog. The information they provide, while trustworthy is rather brief. Websites like dogtime.com and vetSTREET give useful information and provide ratings of different dog breeds based on different characteristics. However,  ratings and information does not always match  with each other, making me question how trustworthy their information is. None of these websites succeed in giving all of the information a user would need to select a dog breed. Missing from these websites is comprehensive information for potential dog owners to select an appropriate dog breed. </p>
