        <h1>How to Find a Dog</h1>

        <p>There are a few more hurdles in adding a dog to your family. Which dog is the right one for you? There so many choices, every puppy is sweet and playful and adult dogs can all look at you with  eyes that are asking you to take them home.  Start your search by thinking about whether you plan to look for a specific dog from a breeder or want to offer a home to a shelter dog, potentially without specific parentage.</p>

        <p>Whether your dog is from a shelter or a kennel you should ask questions. It is advisable to find out the type and quantity of food the dog has been eating. Find out if your dog has been microchipped, no need to microchip twice. Ask about health issues, health records and a recommendation of a veterinarian. Shelters may have less information, but will share whatever information they have. A breeder should have answers and be a source of information for you, throughout your dog’s life.</p>

              <h2>Adopting a Dog</h2>
              <p>Shelter dogs always come with many unknowns. A guess can be made about their breed but it is generally that, a guess. What breed a dog is will relate to its size and temperament so it is important to make sure you are ready to care for a dog without necessarily knowing its exact size or temperament. If you are allergic to dogs, it might be difficult to ensure a dog from a shelter is a hypoallergenic dog.</p>
