              <p>1/26/17</p>
              <p>This week I spent most of my time exploring ideas for my project. I started by conducting research online, analyzing what tools are available to help people learn about dogs and selecting a dog breed. After reviewing several websites I realized it would be nearly impossible for someone to find enough information on one website to make an informed decision when selecting a dog breed. Some websites give detailed information about a dog breed but do not explain what living environment they would need. Other websites provide rating systems on different dog breads explaining things like how adaptable, active, friendly and noisy a specific breed is. While this information is relevant it is not very reliable. There are several websites that have rating systems, Vetstreet, DogTime and Pets4Homes to name a few. The issue I found with these websites is that when compared, their information does not always match up. Reviewing different websites helped me realize that I should create a website where people can quickly find all of the information they need to know about a dog. On this website people will be able to complete a profile to see how they match with different dog breeds, view information about different dog breeds, understand the costs of owning a dog and learn about breeders and dog adoption. After deciding what information I would like to provide on the website I ordered two books, The Dog Encyclopedia and The Dog Selector to help me learn more about different dog breeds and selection one that matches your lifestyle.

            <p>After deciding what I wanted to create for my capstone I began conducting more research. I continued my research online, looking at more websites providing information on dog breeds. I also explored reasons people might return a dog. This helped me to gain insight on what types of questions should be asked when a user is creating a profile with Fur Me. The books I had ordered last week also expanded my knowledge of dog breeds and how they might be matched to different people. While most of my time this week was spent conducting research, I also began writing a project proposal for Fur Me. In addition to a written document I also I created a presentation explaining my project.</p>

                <p>This week I began the process of planning how I will complete my capstone project, Fur Me. I started by assesing what I had already accomplished and what I still need to do to complete Fur Me. After writing down everying I want to accomplish I inputed each task into a Gantt chart. This helped me plan the timeframe in which I would need to accomplish each task. Viewing the Gantt chart as a whole allowed me to visualize the work needed for my entire project and understand what I will need to do to complete it.</p>

After talking with my professor I began learning more about JavaScript objects and how to code them.</p>

                <p>In order to begin coding Fur Me I needed to have an understanding of the basic structure of the applications pages. To accomplish this I began creating wireframes for the application. With some sketched wireframes already completed I began creating digital wireframes with Sketch. Wireframing the breed information pages helped me to organize content and analyse how information should be displayed. This process helped me to visualize how the application might function and assisted me in enhancing the structure of my dog breed database.</p>

                <p>3/2/17</p>
                <p>After creating some wireframes I began reading about different JavaScript frameworks. I knew I would need some type of database to create an authentication system and save all of the information on different dog breeds. Because I am more comfortable coding in JavaScript than PHP I started looking into how I could create a web application with JavaScript. I looked at several different JavaScript frameworks such as Ember, Vue and Angular. I was drawn toward Ember because I felt I understood it the best. However, after starting to work with Ember I found myself struggling to find tutorials and documentation for the most recent version of Ember. Because of this I ultimately decided to user Angular to code the application.</p>

                <p>With the decision made to code Fur Me with Angular I began the process of learning the framework. Unfortunately, I learned very quickly that this process would be much slower than I had hoped. I started out thinking I could just jump in and start creating an application. This idea proved to be incorrect. The code for Angular is very different than anything I have seen before so I needed to start at the beginning, reading through documentation and watching practice tutorials. While this process is slow I have been learning a lot and hopefully I will be able to create the application, or at least something similar to it by May.</p>

                <p>This week I watched some tutorials online and built out the login and authentication system for Fur Me. I created the authentication system using Mongo DB, Passport.js and JWT authentication. This was a bit more time consuming than it should have been since I am still new to Angular. However, I was able to go through a tutorial and set up an authentication system that allows a user to view their personal account.</p>

                <p>With a completed login and authentication system I began building the database for the different dog breeds and creating the different pages of the website. I had some setbacks this week. Angular 2 was updated to Angular 4, which caused a few issues. I had to go back and update some of my code to work properly. After I had resolved these issues I was able to create a form and input data into a database locally on my computer.</p>

                <p>4/13/17</p>
                <p>After some setbacks last week and some additional issues, I have decided to move away from Angular for now. In consideration for the time left to complete my project I have chosen to recreate the website without a JavaScript framework. While this puts me behind schedule I believe it will give me the best chance of completing a prototype of the website before May 5th. I will be using Foundation to assist with the styling of the website and speed up my process. Since making this decision I have created a JavaScript file with information on the 50 most popular dog breeds. I met with Erin Brown yesterday who helped me to think about how I might display the information on the website. I also created the page structure and created a navigation for the site. In addition, I began creating my project pitch for Fur Me.</p>

                <p>This week I continued working on the Fur Me website. With some help I was able to complete the database of dog breeds and connect it to the website. After completing the database of breeds I was able to create the list view and single breed view for all of the dog breeds. I then moved on to attempt to create some kind of search or filtering feature for the list view. After spending some time working on this I realized I would have to leave a search feature for version 2 of the website. Refocusing my efforts on completing the website I was able to complete a version to use for usability testing.</p>

                <p>After completing version 1 of the website I began usability testing. I conducted usability tests with 7 participants. The tests were mainly positive. Several participants commented that they would like a search feature on the page containing the list of dog breeds. I was not at all surprised by this, and hope to be able to add a search feature in version 2 of the website. Additionally, I received the feedback that it was confusing that clicking the back arrow on the browser when on the single breed view does not take you back to the breed list. This feedback was also not completely surprising. This issue occurs because of the way I coded the page of the website. Unfortunately, it is not an easy fix so I will have to wait to make the change in the second version of the Fur Me.</p>
